# About

This is a quick and dirty extension that gives easy access to the local and deployed verions of our monorepo applications.

# Running This Extension

- Clone this repository.
- Load this directory in Chrome as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
- In your extensions toolbar, click the Casechek icon
- Enter a PR number for the PR links to work properly; local/dev/staging should always work.
